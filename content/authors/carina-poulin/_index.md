Whether you need someone to teach your new trainee about phytoplankton culture work, or you have a previously abandoned paper that needs to be completed and published, I can lend my 10+ years of experience in bio-optical oceanography. 

I can help you with:

* Setting up a new lab or updating an old one
* Student and postdoc training (for lab work, communications, etc.)
* Data analysis
* Preparing figures
* Writing scientific articles
* Preparing scientific presentations
* Preparing outreach material
* Building websites
