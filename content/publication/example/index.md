abstract: Diurnal variations of phytoplankton size distributions, chlorophyll,
  carbon and nitrogen content, in vivo fluorescence and associated optical
  absorption and scattering properties were observed in the laboratory to help
  understand in situ and spatial observations. We grew triplicate
  semi-continuous cultures of T. pseudonana, D. tertiolecta, P. tricornutum and
  E. huxleyi under a sinusoidal light regime. We observed diurnal variations in
  the particulate absorption (ap), scattering (bp), attenuation (cp), and
  backscattering coefficients (bbp), which correlate with carbon and Chl
  concentrations. Relative variations from sunrise of bbp are slightly lower
  than those of cp, suggesting that bbp diurnal increases observed in nature are
  partly caused by phytoplankton. Non-concurrent changes of carbon and
  Chl-specific backscattering and scattering coefficients and optical
  cross-sections however indicates that using backscattering to infer scattering
  or biomass must be done with care.
