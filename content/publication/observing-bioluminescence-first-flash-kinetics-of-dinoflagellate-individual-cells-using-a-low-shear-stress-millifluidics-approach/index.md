abstract: Bioluminescent dinoflagellates emit light when exposed to shear
  stresses above a certain threshold. Studying how flow can trigger individual
  cell flashes and observing their kinetics can help us understand how
  bioluminescent flashes occur in nature. We devised a unique millifluidics
  apparatus essentially composed of a syringe pump and a glass capillary where
  dinoflagellate cells are injected. The first bioluminescent flash of cells was
  captured using a camera. Flashes were tracked from the onset of the first
  visible emission of light to the last, and integrated densities of flashes
  were obtained for every frame of the video. Living cells were counted
  downstream in a second glass capillary using a 405 nm laser and a camera
  capturing red fluorescent flashes from chlorophyll, and counter-verified by
  microscope counts. We modelled the velocity and shear stress cells experienced
  in the system from the dimensions and measured flow rates using ANSYS Fluent.
  The cells reached a maximum average shear stress of 0.5 N/m2, five times the
  reported shear threshold for Pyrocystis fusiformis. We observed the typical
  “first flash” waveform, consistent with what had been measured with other
  methods, and roughly ten times more intense than the following flashes for P.
  fusiformis. Our results indicate that a higher level of shear stress could
  produce a higher flash intensity. The proportion of cells flashing increased
  with higher shear stress within the studied range. Our method also allowed us
  to observe the flow-stimulated kinetics of the first flash to study the
  photoinhibition of bioluminescence in Pyrocystis fusiformis.
