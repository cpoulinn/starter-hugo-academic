abstract: Assessing the effect of light pollution, Microcystis aeruginosa was
  grown with and without low levels of night lighting. Significant differences
  were observed between the treatments in the maximum quantum yield of charge
  separation, the intracellular chlorophyll a concentration, the functional
  absorption cross-section of photosystem II, the number of Rubisco per cell and
  per chlorophyll a, the number of photosystem I per chlorophyll a, and the
  chlorophyll a fraction not bound to the photosystems and IsiA.
