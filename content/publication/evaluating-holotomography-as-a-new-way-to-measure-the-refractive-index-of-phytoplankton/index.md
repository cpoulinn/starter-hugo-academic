abstract: The refractive index of phytoplankton directly affects their optical
  properties, particularly backscattering, and by extension, their observation
  by remote sensing. It has notably been linked to intracellular carbon
  concentration, making it an important factor for ocean carbon cycling
  monitoring. Measuring refractive indices of inhomogeneous particles has
  historically been challenging, with the most common approach being the
  immersion of particles in liquids of different known refractive indices until
  they become difficult to discern under a microscope or until the turbidity
  attains a minimum. Other ways include inversion of scattering from a flow
  cytometer using the Lorentz-Mie theory. However, these methods do not allow
  the observation of sub-cellular refractive index structures, which are
  believed, from modelling studies, to strongly influence backscattering. A new
  technology, holotomography, consisting of a 3-dimensional microscope measuring
  the scattering of a 520 nm laser beam at 45Â° to calculate refractive indices
  at a resolution of 200 nm, allows measuring the refractive index of particles
  in more details than it was ever possible before. We share our observations of
  phytoplankton with holotomography to evaluate the limits and possibilities of
  the new technology. We found that holotomography allows detailed measurements
  of phytoplankton cellular structure and of the repartition of the refractive
  indexes within cells and also cell assemblages. Limits of the technique
  include spatial resolution and optimization is necessary to observe thin outer
  cellular structures. Furthermore, the method allows the measurement of the
  volumes of intracellular structures as well as the observation of the
  three-dimensional shapes of the cells and of their internal structures. These
  parameters, obtained with holotomography, will be included in optical models
  to evaluate their impact on model closure.
