abstract: Diel variations of inherent optical properties (absorption
  coefficient, attenuation coefficient and volume scattering function at 124°)
  of four species of phytoplankton were measured in the laboratory and were
  simulated using a homogeneous spherical model, a coated spherical model and a
  homogeneous hexahedral model. The required inputs to run each optical model
  were acquired from the measurements; the real and imaginary parts of the
  refractive index were determined from the intracellular carbon and absorption
  coefficient, and particle size distributions from the Coulter counter. We
  conducted a sensitivity analysis on the inherent optical properties in
  response to changes in the slope of Junge distributions that were used to
  represent non-phytoplankton particles of radii less than 1.12 µm (the minimum
  size of the Coulter counter), realistic maximum and minimum values of the
  refractive indices used for the shell and core, shell thickness, cell radius
  and the number of cells. We found that the shell's refractive index is the
  most important factor influencing the backscattering ratio. We found that the
  coated spherical model reproduced the observed optical properties best for all
  species possessing a shell. The hexahedral and homogenous spherical models
  give relatively good results for the absorption and attenuation coefficients;
  but underestimated the volume scattering function at 124°. Correlations
  between the measured backscattering cross sections and carbon are significant
  only for E. huxleyi and D. tertiolecta. In situ measurements will be necessary
  to determine if our models can reproduce the diel variations of backscattering
  that are observed in the ocean.
