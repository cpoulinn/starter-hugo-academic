title: GLIMR Applications Workshop 2022
abstract: >+
  The NASA GLIMR Science & Applications team invites the research, applied
  sciences, resource management, and decision-making communities to the 1st
  GLIMR Applications Workshop that will be held virtually on September 16th,
  2022, at 12pm-4pm ET.


  The Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) is NASAâ€™s new satellite mission that will provide unique high frequency, high spatial, high accuracy, and hyper-spectral observations to quantify and understand key coastal ocean processes that vary on short temporal and spatial scales. GLIMR will provide federal, state, and local agencies with vital information on coastal hazards (such as oil spills, harmful algal blooms, post-storm assessment, and water quality) for improved response, containment, and public advisories both at sea and along the coast. From its geostationary vantage point, GLIMR will advance coastal science, enabling improved management and hazard mitigation that benefit human health, ecosystem health, and the national economy.


  This event will introduce the GLIMR mission and will discuss how measurements from the vantage point of geostationary orbit offer an unprecedented potential to benefit society, inform stakeholders, and support decision-making in the context of coastal hazards, disasters, resource management, human health, food security, climate change, and ecological forecasting.


  The objectives of the workshop are:


  -Provide an overview of the GLIMR mission, data, science, and applications

  -Understand critical needs and challenges of communities that are interested in working with GLIMR data and identify ways to address these challenges

  -Promote synergies with other Earth missions, expand community engagement within the GLIMR Communities of Practice and Potential as well as other stakeholders, and identify opportunities for capacity development


  The GLIMR Mission will allow stakeholders to address cross-disciplinary research and applied science. This event encourages collaboration across disciplines and invites participation of individuals and organizations with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise, across different sectors and countries.


  The workshop will include:


  -Keynote presentations on the GLIMR instrument, data products, science and applications foci areas, and multi-mission synergies.

  -Live panel sessions to discuss critical needs and challenges of communities that are interested in working with GLIMR data and identify ways to address these challenges

  -Networking opportunities and small group discussions for additional feedback
