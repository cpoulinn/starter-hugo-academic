title: NASA PACE Applications Workshop 2022
abstract: >+
  This event will focus on advancing the application readiness and societal
  value of future PACE satellite data, research, and applications. We will
  collectively identify next steps to address barriers and gaps to ensure PACE
  data accessibility, usability, and actionability.


  The PACE mission is NASA’s next great investment in Earth Science, continuing NASA’s legacy of over forty years of satellite ocean color measurements. PACE, expected to launch in January 2024, will advance our Earth-observing and monitoring capabilities through hyperspectral imaging and multi-angle polarimetric observations of ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial ecosystems. PACE will give us an unprecedented view of our home planet and will support user-driven environmental applications through research and applied science to address societal challenges and inform decision-making!


  This year we aim to:


  Provide an overview of PACE instruments, data, science & applications.

  Understand data needs & challenges of the communities that are interested in working with PACE data, and co-develop action steps for addressing these challenges.

  Identify new research and applications that align with PACE stakeholders and decision-making communities.

  Cultivate strategic partnerships and community engagement within the PACE Community of Practice, other Earth missions, resource managers, and decision-makers.

  The PACE Applications team invites participants interested in applying PACE data for research, resource management, decision-making, public health, and others across water resources, air quality and health, climate, disasters, ecological forecasting and other NASA Applied Sciences thematic areas. The event will encourage collaboration from individuals and organizations from diverse backgrounds including US and international universities, research organizations, government agencies, as well as the commercial, non-profit, and private sectors.


  Keynote presentations on co-production, data discovery, and multi-mission synergies.

  Live panel sessions and informal Q&As with industry professionals across social sciences, Earth observation data management, and applied research and operations.

  Poster sessions highlighting work by members of the PACE community including PACE Early Adopters and PACE Science & Application Teams.

  PACE resource library and pre-recorded presentations from the members of PACE Project Science.

  Networking opportunities via 1:1 or group meeting spaces and virtual lounges.

  This will be the third in a series of annual PACE Applications workshops. The event is open to all participants. Registration is required, but free to attend.
